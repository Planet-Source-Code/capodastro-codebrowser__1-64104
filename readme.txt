I got bored by the eternal browsing in the IDE labyrinth; why not try to build an extended project explorer?
Microsoft left the IDE object unfinished and I was wondering if something like this would be still possible. After checking all examples available on the net, I started with experiments. In same cases I found some little undocumented features, otherwise dirty but working tricks. The code is not elegant and furthermore I found the use of repetitions necessary to assure the necessary stability. The error routines are still the program foundation. At this point I used the CodeBrowser for a while and it seams to work well. Two Italian colleagues helped as testers.
Please don’t forget that this addin is incompatible with any other mouse hook.
I didn’t add a context menu while all items are already available in the IDE menu.
 I used the MS Windowless controls to save resources, they are downloadable by Microsoft: I added them to this package for your convenience. 
Have fun
